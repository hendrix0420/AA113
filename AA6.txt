This is different from descend and maintain descend and maintain ignores every restriction you can start in an immediate and unrestricted descent down to the descend and maintain altitude and so the problem is they sound pretty much the same descend and maintain flight level 190 means you can start down to 190 you don't have to worry about any of the restrictions on any of the fixes and this set descend via the CREDE 3 except maintain flight level 190 that means you still have to follow all the restrictions except once you reach 190 you're going to just stay at that altitude
