The tough thing with this procedure really just comes down to the terminology descend via descend via except maintain and descend and maintain and that's an area everybody kind of tends to get confused and you can miss hear it over the radios so you'll hear pilots kind of clarify that descend via except maintain means you have to comply with every altitude restriction lateral and speed as well until you meet the maintain altitude descend and maintain means you still need to fly the lateral portion and the speed restrictions but you can descend unrestricted down to their maintain altitude and then once you're there you're gonna hold it
