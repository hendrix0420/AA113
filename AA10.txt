Today a Tupolev 154 performed a gear-up touchdown during its landing here at Almaty airport it's skidded on the runway but fortunately was able to take off and land normally after a go-around the passengers were very lucky to have landed without any injuries I have Mr Oblovsky with me a spokesperson for the airport Mr oblovsky I understand that the ground proximity warning system which warns the crew to lower the undercarriage was switched off is that correct yes it's true because the approach is so low just 100 meters over the mountains the warning was going off all the time and was distracting the crew and that led to the aircraft landing with gear up no the approach was faster than expected and because the runway was occupied by another aircraft a 757 the pilot decided to do a go around
