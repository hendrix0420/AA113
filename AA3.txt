The MSA is only used for emergencies I have never found I've met a pilot on an IFR procedure who's actually used the MSA so essentially the reason you're gonna use MSA is because you can't reach air traffic control or they can longer see you for some reason so either your radios are out or their radar is out transponders out and you're not in primary radar visibility and at the same time you've lost your position and you can no longer navigate the procedure
