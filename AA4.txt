So that's a descend via and in that case a ATC does not need to give you an altitude all they have to do is say descend via the CREDE arrival and then you need to make each of those restrictions on your way down but oftentimes ATC will want to hold you high and that could be because maybe there's a cirrus somewhere on the arrival below you so they're gonna give you a descend via except maintain and this is very confusing because a descend via except maintain means you still need to comply with all of the restrictions until you get to the except maintain altitude so descend via the CREDE 3 except maintain flight level 190 you still have to apply or comply with all of the altitude restrictions until you get to 190 and then you maintain that plus you have the lateral and the speed this is different from descend and maintain descend and maintain ignores every restriction you can start in an immediate and unrestricted descent down to the descend and maintain altitude and so the problem is they sound pretty much the same descend and maintain flight level 190 means you can start down to 190 you don't have to worry about any of the restrictions on any of the fixes and this set descend via the CREDE 3 except maintain flight level 190 that means you still have to follow all the restrictions except once you reach 190 you're going to just stay at that altitude
