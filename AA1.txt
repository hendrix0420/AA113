When you look at these arrivals sometimes the altitudes don't seem to make sense because you'll go okay wait a second that one's got a restriction of 17000 feet why would you have a block of 17 to 190 I'm not gonna climb back up and that's right it just means that ATC oftentimes will give you a descend via except maintain for that route and so they know that ATC will be deleting that restriction and keeping aircraft high and then the beauty is once they maybe make it onto this next segment ATC can give you another clearance which removes that restriction and now you need to comply with the rest of the procedures and the easiest way for ATC to do that is just simply say descend via again
