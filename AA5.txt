So essentially if you lost all of your navigation capability you're no longer on a route you can't figure out where you are the MSA is a fallback hey just make sure you're above the MSA and you won't hit anything well of course in the real world if you lost all of your navigation capability the first thing you do is you talk to air traffic control and they would probably have a primary return so MSA is kind of like the last worst case scenario and especially in transport category modern aircraft used so much in redundant avionics ATC it's pretty rare that being said you'd use it if you completely lost track of where you are you have no idea you know that if you get above that MSA you're not going to hit anything
